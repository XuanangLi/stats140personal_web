Utilized Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) for model identification and performed a comparative analysis of six data transformation models based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to identify the optimal ARMA model. Conducted residual diagnostics using ACF plots and portmanteau tests, confirming that residuals adhered to white noise properties, indicative of a well-fitting model.\n3. Developed and implemented an ARIMA(2,0,2) model to forecast ten future data points, showcasing predictive capabilities in a real-world economic context."
